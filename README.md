# CarPorject
Brief Project Description:
This app enables users to quickly search through and list the used car inventory of a dealership
by each car's mileage. The app makes use of a Red-Black Tree to efficiently insert the car data
and retrieve it in a sorted manner. The data is loaded from a local data file that the user
specifies.
Representative Tasks Performed Using this Application:
1. Search for and list the cars with the lowest mileage in the inventory.
2. Search for and list all cars that have 900,000 or more miles.
